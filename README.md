A big flaw of Ethereum is that if you lose your seed, you have lost basically everything.
It's a good thing, because it's your responsibility to keep your seed safe and not lose it.

With this project you'll be able to have an address that have no seed, but only a password. If you lose that password, you still can get a new one that you'll receive in your e-mail.

It has pros and cons, it's up to you to evaluate.
